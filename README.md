## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling

#### Tilesets

- Resample down from `NearestNeighbor` in Photoshop.
- Tiles need to be `32x32` and extruded to remove edge bleed.

```bash
npm install --global tile-extruder
```

```bash
tile-extruder --tileWidth 32 --tileHeight 32 --input ./public/assets/tilesets/clean/grassland.png --output ./public/assets/tilesets/grassland.png
```

## ‚úÖ Todo list

#### Items

- [ ] Suffix / Prefix system improvements
- [ ] Spawned item mods `min` needs to take `max` into account
- [ ] Gloves items

#### Systems

- [ ] Fix party system to update stats properly
- [ ] Trade window

#### Combat

#### Performance

- [ ] How to make servers smart about not loading map rooms until a person is actually in them.
- [ ] Move spell cooldowns to serverside check
