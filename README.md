- Resample down from `NearestNeighbor` in Photoshop.
- Tiles need to be `32x32` and extruded to remove edge bleed.

```bash
npm install --global tile-extruder
```

```bash
tile-extruder --tileWidth 32 --tileHeight 32 --input ./public/assets/tilesets/clean/grassland.png --output ./public/assets/tilesets/grassland.png
```

## ‚úÖ Todo list

#### Items

- [ ] Suffix / Prefix system improvements
- [ ] Spawned item mods `min` needs to take `max` into account

#### Cosmetic

- [ ] Animated weapons

#### Systems

- [ ] Trade window
- [ ] Minimap
- [ ] Doors that require a key or level to pass through
- [ ] Ability to choose from mage-type rogue-type or warrior-type rewards on some quests

#### Combat

- [ ] Serverside individual cooldowns for spells
- [ ] More spells that effect movement, (dives, dodges, pushback etc)
- [ ] Back-stab damage
- [ ] Show warning before enemies attack

#### Performance

- [ ] Predictive hero movement so we do not have to send `[x,y]` @ 60fps and so other players aren't able to hit you when you are not near them.
- [ ] Multiple `Realms` because 1000 people in a map will not scale.
- [ ] How to make servers smart about not loading map rooms until a person is actually in them.
